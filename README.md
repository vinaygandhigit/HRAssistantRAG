# HRAssistantRAG
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying HR policies using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model and FAISS vector search. This project extracts text from policy documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), builds a FAISS index for efficient retrieval, and provides a user-friendly Streamlit interface with a chat-like UI for answering policy-related questions.
