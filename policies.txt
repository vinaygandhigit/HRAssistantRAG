Code of ethics policy  
This professional code of ethics example is ready to be tailored to 
your company’s needs. Complement this sample with other 
elements of a code of conduct policy  and add both to a complete 
employee handbook . 
Policy brief & purpose  
Our professional code of ethics policy aims to give our employees guidelines 
on our business ethics and stance on various controversial matters. We trust 
you to use your better judgment, but we want to provide you with a concrete 
guide you can fall back on  if you’re unsure about how you should act (e.g. in 
cases of conflict of interest). We will also use this policy to outline the 
consequences of violating our business code of ethics.  
Scope  
This policy applies to everyone we employ or have business relations with. 
This includes individual people such as employees, interns, volunteers, but 
also business entities, such as vendors, enterprise customers or venture 
capital companies.  
Note that our code of ethics is slightly different than our code of conduct . 
Code of conduct may include elements such as dress code and social media 
use, whilst our code of professional ethics refers to legally or morally charged 
issues. Still, these two codes do overlap.  
Policy elements  
What is meant by code of professional ethics?  
First, let’s define professional ethics: they are a set of principles that guide the 
behavior of people in a business context. They are essential to maintaining 
the legality of business and a healthy workplace.  
So what is a code  of ethics? Our code of ethics definition refers to the 
standards that apply to a specific setting – in this case, our own organization.  
What is the purpose of a professional code of 
ethics?  
Having our business ethics in writing doesn’t mean that we don’t trust our 
employees. We strive to hire ethical people who have their own personal 
standards, so we expect that a written code won’t be necessary most of the 
time.  
But, it can still be helpful. You may find yourself in a situation where you’re not 
sure how you should act. Life is full of grey areas where right and wrong aren’t 
so apparent. Some professional ethics also correspond to laws that you 
absolutely must know  to do your job properly, so we will mention them in our 
code of ethics.  
Additionally, every organization makes bad hires every once in a while. We 
also can’t predict how people are going to behave. When an employee 
behaves, or intents to behave, in a way that’s against our professional ethics, 
or applicable laws, we will have clear guidelines on what disciplinary actions 
we will consider.  
For these reasons, we advise you to read this document carefully and consult 
with your manager or HR, if you have doubts or questions.  
The components of our code of professional 
ethics:  
We base our business code of ethics on common principles of ethics [ Note: 
Modify this list based on your own organization’s values ]: 
● Respect for others . Treat people as you want to be treated.  
● Integrity and honesty . Tell the truth and avoid any wrongdoing to the 
best of your ability.  
● Justice . Make sure you’re objective and fair and don’t disadvantage 
others.  
● Lawfulness . Know and follow the law – always.  
● Competence and accountability . Work hard and be responsible for 
your work.  
● Teamwork . Collaborate and ask for help.  
Here’s a more detailed overview of our code:  
Respect for others  
It’s mandatory to respect everyone you interact with. Be kind, polite and 
understanding. You must respect others’ personal space, opinions and 
privacy. Any kind of violence  is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate 
termination. You’re also not allowed to harass or victimize others.  
What constitutes harassment or victimization? To answer this, we have a 
policy on harassment  and a more specific policy on sexual harassment  you 
can take a look at. As a general rule, try to put yourself in someone else’s 
place. How would you feel if someone behaved a specific way to you? If the 
answer is “I wouldn’t like it much” or “I would never let them behave like that to 
me”, then we don ’t tolerate this behavior no matter the person it comes from.  
If someone, be it customer, colleague or stakeholder, is offensive, demeaning 
or threatening toward you or someone you know, report them immediately to 
HR or your manager. You can also report rudeness and dismissiveness if they 
become excessive or frequent . 
Integrity and honesty  
First, always keep in mind our organization’s mission. We all work together to 
achieve specific outcomes. Your behavior should contribute to our goals, 
whether financial or organizational.  
Be honest and transparent when you act in ways that impact other people 
(e.g. taking strategic decisions or deciding on layoffs). We don’t tolerate 
malicious, deceitful or petty conduct. Lies and cheating are huge red flags 
and, if you’re discovered, you m ay face progressive discipline  or immediate 
termination depending on the damage you did.  
Stealing from the company or other people is illegal. If you’re caught, you will 
face repercussions depending on the severity of your actions. For example, if 
you steal office supplies, you may receive a reprimand or demotion (at a 
minimum), while if you s teal money or data (e.g. engaging in fraud or 
embezzlement), you will get fired and face legal consequences. The decision 
is at HR’s discretion on a case -by-case basis.  
Conflict of interest  
Conflict of interest may occur whenever your interest in a particular subject 
leads you to actions, activities or relationships that undermine our company. 
This includes situations like using your position’s authority for your own 
personal gain or exploiti ng company resources to support a personal money -
making business. Even when you seemingly act to the company’s advantage, 
you may actually disadvantage it. For example, if an employee uses dubious 
methods to get competitor intel and raise their sales recor d, their action will 
have a positive impact on the company’s revenue, but it will put us at a legal 
risk and promote unhealthy business practices.  
If it turns out you have created a conflict of interest for yourself, you will be 
terminated. If the conflict of interest was involuntary (e.g. buying stocks from a 
company without knowing they’re a competitor), we will take actions to rectify 
the situatio n. If you repeat the offence, you may be terminated.  
Justice  
Don’t act in a way that exploits others, their hard work or their mistakes. Give 
everyone equal opportunity and speak up when someone else doesn’t.  
Be objective when making decisions that can impact other people, including 
when you’re deciding to hire, promote or fire someone. Be sure that you can 
justify any decision with written records or examples. Seek and use the most 
objective methods in any cas e; for example, when interviewing candidates, 
ask the same interview questions to all of them and avoid judging non -job-
related criteria, like dress, appearance, etc.  
Also, don’t discriminate against people with protected characteristics, as this 
is forbidden by [ laws under the purview of the EEOC ]. If you suspect you may 
have an unconscious bias that influences your decisions (taking Harvard’s 
Implicit Association Test could help you determine this), ask for help from HR.  
When exercising authority, be fair. Don’t show favoritism toward specific 
employees and be transparent when you decide to praise or reward an 
employee. You’re also obliged to follow our employment of relatives policy , 
which forbids you from having a reporting relationship with a relative.  
If you need to discipline an employee, be sure to have prepared a case that 
you can present to HR. You must not retaliate against employees or 
applicants  (such as in cases when they’ve filed complaints) as this is 
forbidden by law . 
Be just toward customers or vendors, too. If you think our company was in the 
wrong in a specific instance, don’t try to cover it up or accuse the other side. 
Discuss with your manager to find solutions that can benefit both sides.  
Lawfulness  
You are obliged to follow all laws which apply to our organization. Depending 
on your role and profession, there might be various laws you need to observe. 
For example, accountants and medical professionals have their own legal 
restrictions and they must b e fully aware of them.  
When you’re preparing contracts, clauses, disclaimers or online copy that may 
be governed by law (such as consent forms), please ask verification from [our 
legal counsel] before finalizing anything.  
You’re also covered by our confidentiality  and data protection policy . You 
must not expose, disclose or endanger information of customers, employees, 
stakeholders or our business. Always follow our cybersecurity policy , too.  
Following laws regarding fraud, bribery, corruption and any kind of assault is a 
given. You are also obliged to follow laws on child labor  and avoid doing 
business with unlawful organizations.  
If you’re not sure what the law is in a specific instance, don’t hesitate to ask 
HR or our legal counsel.  
Competence and accountability  
We all need to put a healthy amount of effort in our work. Not just because 
we’re all responsible for the organization’s success, but also because slacking 
off affects our colleagues. Incomplete or slow working might hinder other 
people’s work or cause the m to shoulder the burden themselves. This comes 
in direct conflict with our respect and integrity principles.  
We also expect you to take up opportunities for learning and development, 
either on -the-job or via educational material or training. If you are unsure how 
you can achieve this, have an open discussion with your manager.  
Also, take responsibility for your actions. We all make mistakes or need to 
make tough decisions and it’s important we own up to them. Failing to be 
accountable on a regular basis or in important situations (e.g. a crucial 
mistake in our financial records)  will result in termination. If you take 
responsibility and come up with ways to fix your mistakes where possible, you 
will be in a far better position.  
 
Teamwork  
Working well with others is a virtue, rather than an obligation. You will 
certainly get to work autonomously and be focused on your own projects and 
responsibilities. But, you should also be ready to collaborate with and help 
others.  
Be generous with your expertise and knowledge. Be open to learning and 
evolving. If days go by without you consulting or brainstorming with anyone, 
you are missing out on opportunities for excellence. Instead, work with others 
and don’t hesitate to ask for  help when you need it

Company cyber security policy template  
This Company cyber security policy template is ready to be tailored to your company’s needs and 
should be considered a starting point for setting up your employment policies.  
Policy brief & purpose  
Our company cyber security policy outlines our guidelines and provisions for preserving the  security of 
our data  and technology infrastructure.  
The more we rely on technology to collect, store and manage information, the more vulnerable we 
become to severe security breaches. Human errors, hacker attacks and system malfunctions could 
cause great financial damage and may jeopardize our company’s rep utation.  
For this reason, we have implemented a number of security measures. We have also prepared 
instructions that may help mitigate security risks. We have outlined both provisions in this policy.  
Scope  
This policy applies to all our employees, contractors, volunteers and anyone who has permanent or 
temporary access to our systems and hardware.  
Policy elements  
Confidential data  
Confidential data  is secret and valuable. Common examples are:  
● Unpublished financial information  
● Data of customers/partners/vendors  
● Patents, formulas or new technologies  
● Customer lists (existing and prospective)  
All employees are obliged to protect this data. In this policy, we will give our employees instructions on 
how to avoid security breaches.  
Protect personal and company devices  
When employees use their  digital devices  to access company emails or accounts, they introduce 
security risk to our data. We advise our employees to keep both their personal and company -issued 
computer, tablet and cell phone secure. They can do this if they:  
 
 ● Keep all devices password protected.  
● Choose and upgrade a complete antivirus software.  
● Ensure they do not leave their devices exposed or unattended.  
● Install security updates of browsers and systems monthly or as soon as updates are available.  
● Log into company accounts and systems through secure and private networks only.  
We also advise our employees to avoid accessing internal systems and accounts from other people’s 
devices or lending their own devices to others.  
When new hires receive company -issued equipment they will receive instructions for:  
● [Disk encryption setup ] 
● [Password management tool setup ] 
● [Installation of antivirus/ anti -malware software ] 
They should follow instructions to protect their devices and refer to our [ Security Specialists/ Network 
Engineers ] if they have any questions.  
Keep emails safe  
Emails  often host scams and malicious software (e.g. worms.) To avoid virus infection or data theft, we 
instruct employees to:  
● Avoid opening attachments and clicking on links when the content is not adequately explained 
(e.g. “watch this video, it’s amazing.”)  
● Be suspicious of clickbait titles (e.g. offering prizes, advice.)  
● Check email and names of people they received a message from to ensure they are legitimate.  
● Look for inconsistencies or give -aways (e.g. grammar mistakes, capital letters, excessive 
number of exclamation marks.)  
If an employee isn’t sure that an email they received is safe, they can refer to our [ IT Specialist .] 
Manage passwords properly  
Password leaks are dangerous since they can compromise our entire infrastructure. Not only should 
passwords be secure so they won’t be easily hacked, but they should also remain secret. For this 
reason, we advice our employees to:  
● Choose passwords with at least eight characters (including capital and lower -case letters, 
numbers and symbols) and avoid information that can be easily guessed (e.g. birthdays.)  
● Remember passwords instead of writing them down. If employees need to write their passwords, 
they are obliged to keep the paper or digital document confidential and destroy it when their work 
is done.  
 
 ● Exchange credentials only when absolutely necessary. When exchanging them in -person isn’t 
possible, employees should prefer the phone instead of email, and only if they personally 
recognize the person they are talking to.  
● Change their passwords every two months.  
Remembering a large number of passwords can be daunting. We will purchase the services of a 
password management tool which generates and stores passwords. Employees are obliged to create a 
secure password for the tool itself, following the abovementioned a dvice.  
Transfer data securely  
Transferring data introduces security risk. Employees must:  
● Avoid transferring sensitive data (e.g. customer information, employee records) to other devices 
or accounts unless absolutely necessary. When mass transfer of such data is needed, we 
request employees to ask our [ Security Specialists ] for help.  
● Share confidential data over the company network/ system and not over public Wi -Fi or private 
connection.  
● Ensure that the recipients of the data are properly authorized people or organizations and have 
adequate security policies.  
● Report scams, privacy breaches and hacking attempts  
Our [ IT Specialists/ Network Engineers ] need to know about scams, breaches and malware so they can 
better protect our infrastructure. For this reason, we advise our employees to report perceived attacks, 
suspicious emails or phishing attempts as soon as possible to our specialists. Our [ IT Specialists/ 
Network Engineers ] must investigate promptly, resolve the issue and send a companywide alert when 
necessary.  
Our Security Specialists are responsible for advising employees on how to detect scam emails. We 
encourage our employees to reach out to them with any questions or concerns.  
Additional measures  
To reduce the likelihood of security breaches, we also instruct our employees to:  
● Turn off their screens and lock their devices when leaving their desks.  
● Report stolen or damaged equipment as soon as possible to [ HR/ IT Department ]. 
● Change all account passwords at once when a device is stolen.  
● Report a perceived threat or possible security weakness in company systems.  
● Refrain from downloading suspicious, unauthorized or illegal software on their company 
equipment.  
● Avoid accessing suspicious websites.  
We also expect our employees to comply with our  social media  and internet usage policy . 
 
 Our [ Security Specialists/ Network Administrators ] should:  
● Install firewalls, anti malware software and access authentication systems.  
● Arrange for security training to all employees.  
● Inform employees regularly about new scam emails or viruses and ways to combat them.  
● Investigate security breaches thoroughly.  
● Follow this policies provisions as other employees do.  
Our company will have all physical and digital shields to protect information.  
Remote employees  
Remote employees  must follow this policy’s instructions too. Since they will be accessing our company’s 
accounts and systems from a distance, they are obliged to follow all data encryption, protection 
standards and settings, and ensure their private network is secure.  
We encourage them to seek advice from our [ Security Specialists/ IT Administrators. ] 
Disciplinary Action  
We expect all our employees to always follow this policy and those who cause security breaches may 
face disciplinary action:  
● First-time, unintentional, small -scale security breach: We may issue a verbal warning and train 
the employee on security.  
● Intentional, repeated or large scale breaches (which cause severe financial or other damage): 
We will invoke more severe disciplinary action up to and including termination.  
We will examine each incident on a case -by-case basis.  
Additionally, employees who are observed to disregard our security instructions will face  progressive 
discipline , even if their behavior hasn’t resulted in a security breach.  
Take security seriously  
Everyone, from our customers and partners to our employees and contractors, should feel that their data 
is safe. The only way to gain their trust is to proactively protect our systems and databases. We can all 
contribute to this by being vigilant and keepi ng cyber security top of mind.

Employee Attendance Policy  
This Employee Attendance Policy  template can help you manage absenteeism and gives you an 
insight on how to set up or improve your company attendance policy for employees. May also be 
referred to as an Attendance Management Policy , Absenteeism Policy , Tardiness Policy . 
 Policy brief & purpose  
Our employee attendance policy outlines our expectations about our employees' coming to work. 
Being punctual when coming to work helps maintain efficiency in our workplace.  
Scope  
This company attendance policy applies to all nonexempt employees regardless of position or type of 
employment.  
Policy elements  
Most employees need to collaborate with their colleagues to do their job. To make this collaboration 
easier, we expect you to be punctual and follow the schedule you and your manager have agreed on. If 
you are absent or late on occasion, you should have a good reason.  
Being consistently tardy or absent can cause problems to your colleagues who may have to shoulder 
your work. This behavior may bring about a “bad attendance” record and you may need to go through  
progressive discipline . 
What is absenteeism and tardiness?  
Absenteeism  refers to frequent absence from an employee’s job responsibilities. This includes not 
coming to work frequently or taking excessive sick leave without being able to submit doctor's notes.  
Presenteeism  refers to being present at work beyond your schedule even when we don't require 
overtime. This can cause you to overwork and have an impact on your productivity and job satisfaction. 
We want to ensure that you keep your schedule both when coming to work a nd leaving.  
Tardiness  refers to coming in late, taking longer  breaks  than you're entitled to and constantly leaving 
earlier from work without reason. We probably won't mind if you're a bit late one morning or leave a little 
earlier on a Friday. But, we want to make sure you generally follow your schedule and you don't caus e 
disruption in our workplace.  
You are responsible for monitoring your working hours through our [ timekeeping system/ software .] 
Please be diligent in recording your hours, so you can receive your due payment.  
Unforeseen absences  
If you can't come in to work one day, notify your manager as soon as possible. If your manager is in a 
different time zone, contact HR instead. Afterwards, you should draw from your remaining PTO or sick 
leave to cover this absence. Please record this in o ur [HR software ] as quickly as possible. Unexcused 
or unreported absence for more than three days will be considered job abandonment. If you need to 
leave work early one day, inform your manager.  
We will understand if you have good reasons for being absent, even if you don't report it. Those reasons 
usually involve serious accidents and family or acute medical emergencies. We may ask you to bring us 
doctor’s notes or other verification. In these ca ses, we will record your absence as "excused."  
The following list, although not exhaustive, includes reasons that we don't consider excused absence:  
● Waking up late.  
● Stopping on the way to work for personal reasons.  
● Traffic or public transportation delays excluding situations that result in closing of roads.  
● Bad weather, excluding extreme weather conditions like blizzards, hurricanes and floods.  
● Holidays  that haven't been approved.  
Good attendance  
Employees who have less than [ three incidents ] of absenteeism or tardiness in a year will receive an 
additional paid day off for next year. You have a good attendance record when you:  
● Report consistently to work.  
● Come to work at the scheduled shift start time.  
● Leave work at the scheduled shift end time (except when  paid overtime  is required.)  
● Remaining at work during working hours (excluding breaks.)  
● Take breaks that don't exceed an expected length.  
● Notify your manager when you need to be absent or late.  
● Be absent or late with good reasons only.  
Manager's responsibility  
If you manage employees you are responsible to monitor their attendance. If you notice that a team 
member is consistently late or absent, arrange a private meeting to discuss. Ask your team member 
whether they experience issues with their schedule or wheth er they need help balancing their personal 
lives with work.  Flexible hours , work from home  or time management training options may provide a 
solution. If you perceive a possible mental health issue  that results in absenteeism or tardiness, ask your 
team member to contact our [ mental health professional ] and discuss what you can do to help them.  
If you suspect that your team member abuses their sick leave or is wilfully tardy, you should inform HR 
and start a progressive discipline process.  
Disciplinary action  
If your manager suspects you abuse your sick leave, you may need to submit doctor's notes to avoid our 
progressive discipline process. If you're being tardy unintentionally, corrective counseling will be our first 
attempt at a solution. We may take discipl inary action that goes up to and including termination if:  
● Corrective counseling doesn't work.  
● We find that you are wilfully tardy.  
● Your tardiness or absenteeism impacts your work.  
Unexcused and unreported absences don't count as hours worked, so we won't compensate them.

Benefits and perks template  
In this section, we describe what we offer to our employees. We provide information on our health 
insurance plans and benefits like work from home options and company -issued equipment.  
Employee health  
Employee health is important to us. We don’t discriminate against people with disabilities or health 
conditions, but we want to do everything possible to  help employees stay healthy . At a minimum, we 
provide [ group health insurance ] to all eligible employees. For more information about our insurance 
package, contact HR.  
[Insert this if you have more than 20 employees in the U.S: According to the Consolidated Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), you may choose to continue your group health benefits for a limited 
period after leaving our company. This can happen after you experience a qualifying event, i.e. 
termination for reasons other than gross misconduct and reduction in your hours of employment. 
Covered spouses and children may also be able to extend their health coverage after certain qualifying 
events. Please as k HR for guidance .] 
 We have also established non -smoking and  substance abuse policies  to protect employee health. We 
will create a workplace with minimal noise and good lighting and offer [ free healthy snacks, wellness 
programs. ] 
Workers’ compensation  
We strive to  keep our workplace safe , but accidents may happen occasionally. Employees who are 
injured at work (by accident or disease) can receive wage replacement, medical care and rehabilitation 
benefits according to workers’ compensation laws, when appropriate. Please inform us of your i njury as 
soon as possible. Ask HR for forms that you need to file a claim or contact your state agency for 
workers’ compensation.  
Our company has a workers’ compensation policy according to guidelines of the states (or countries) we 
operate in. [ Insert summary of your workers compensation insurance packages and details on who will 
handle workers’ compensation when employees are injured. If you operate in multiple states or 
countries, mention any specific guidelines and, if possible, provide employ ees with contact details of 
workers compensation boards for the states or countries you operate in. ] 
Work from home  
If your job doesn’t require you to be present at our premises, you can  occasionally work from home 
(WFH) . We normally allow [ one day per week .] If you need to telecommute for more days per week, talk 
to your manager.  
Please inform your manager that you want to work from home [ using our HRIS ] at least [ two days ] in 
advance. [ You can also set a recurring WFH day per week .] If there’s a rare emergency, you may work 
from home without having received prior approval, but call or email your manager as soon as possible. If 
they are in a different time -zone, contact HR instead.  
When you are working from home, please use an internet connection and devices that are fast and 
secure. Choose a place without loud noises or distractions. And, check in with your team frequently to 
make collaboration easier.  
If there is inclement weather (e.g. a blizzard) please check your [ email ] to see if the office is officially 
closed. If you judge that your commute during inclement weather is dangerous, let us know. We will not 
force you to come to work if your safety is at stake or if there is an official travel warning.  
Remote working  
Remote working  refers to working from a non -office location on a temporary or permanent basis.  
If you’re an office -based employee, you may work remotely for a maximum of [ two consecutive weeks ] 
per year. You may arrange this if you [ are a new parent or suffer from a short -term disability. ] If you have 
 another reason, talk to your manager. Submit your remote working requests [ through our HRIS ] at least 
[one week ] in advance.  
If you work remotely permanently, we ask that you adhere to our security, confidentiality and equal 
opportunity policies just like your office -based colleagues.  
Employee expenses  
There are some expenses that we will pay directly on your behalf (e.g. hotel rooms for work -related 
travel.) But, we ask you to keep track and report on those reimbursable expenses that you pay yourself. 
We reimburse employee expenses  that are related to:  
● [Business travel ] 
● [Relocation ] 
● [Education and training ] 
● [Upon approval, outings with business partners or colleagues ] 
Not all travel expenses are reimbursable. For example, we will pay for your transportation to an airport 
for work -related travel, but not to a museum for a personal visit. Before traveling for business, contact 
HR to clarify which expenses are reimbursable  within your particular trip.  
Please keep receipts for all reimbursable expenses. You can submit them to your manager [ through our 
expense software ] within [ three months ] after the date of each expense. If your manager approves your 
expenses, you will receive your reimbursement within [ two] pay periods [ by check .] 
Company car  
You may drive a company car if you:  
● Need it as an indispensable part of your job (e.g. truck drivers and delivery drivers.)  
● Receive it as a benefit attached to your job.  
Either way, your car belongs to our company. You may use your company vehicle for personal reasons 
as our  company car policy  permits. You will get reimbursed only for approved, business -related 
expenses.  
To get a company car, you should have a valid driver’s license and a clean driving record for at least 
[two years .] Drive safe and sober and respect traffic laws and fellow motorists. You should also check 
your car regularly to ensure gas, tire pressure and all car fluids are at appropriate levels.

● Using a company car to teach someone how to drive.  
 ● Leaving your company car unlocked, unattended or parked in dangerous areas.

On our part, we will ensure that our cars are safe and in good condition, as well as appropriately 
insured.  
Accidents  
If you are involved in an accident with a company car, contact our HR department immediately, so we 
can get in touch with our insurance provider. You shouldn’t accept responsibility or guarantee payment 
to another person without authorization.  
Follow this policy’s guidelines to avoid disciplinary action. For minor offenses, like allowing unauthorized 
people to drive a company car, we will reprimand you or reclaim your car. But for more serious offenses, 
like causing an accident while intoxicated , we may terminate you.  
Parking  
We will prioritize  parking space assignments  for [employees with disabilities, executives and employees 
who drive company vehicles .] We will then allocate our remaining parking spaces on a first -come, first -
served basis. Interns and trainees may also receive parking spaces. If you want to receive a parking 
spot, file your request with our [ HR department/ facilities manager .] 
We expect you to keep our parking lot clean and use only your assigned space. Please behave 
responsibly to avoid causing damage, injury or loss of property.  
We will not assume any liability for theft, vandalism, fire or damage regarding an employee’s vehicle in 
our parking lot.  
Company -issued equipment  
As an employee, you may receive [ company cell phone, laptop or other device, furniture .] Unless 
otherwise mentioned in your contract, any equipment we offer belongs to our company and you may not 
sell it or give it away. You are also responsible for keeping our equipment safe and in as good condition 
as possible. If your equipment breaks or  malfunctions, let us know so we can arrange to get it repaired.  
If you are part of our  corporate cell phone plan , please use your phone within our plan’s restraints. You 
may have to pay any extra charges yourself.  
Theft and damage of company equipment  
Our equipment is insured for theft and damage. We ask you to inform us within [ 24 hours ] if your 
equipment is stolen or damaged. We might be able to trace stolen laptops and cell phones. Please also 
file a theft statement (affidavit) with the police and submit a copy to us.  
 Security of company issued devices  
We advise you to keep your company -issued computer, tablet and cell phone secure. You can do this if 
you: 
● Keep all devices password -protected.  
● Ensure you do not leave your devices unattended.  
● Install security updates for browsers and other systems as soon as updates are available.  
● Log into company accounts and systems through secure and private networks only.  
● Follow all instructions for disk encryption, anti -malware protection and password management 
that you received along with your equipment.

Employee bonus policy template  
This employee bonus policy template is ready to be tailored to your company’s needs and can be a 
starting point for setting up your employment policies.  
Policy brief & purpose  
Our employee bonus policy explains how our company distributes bonuses to employees. We want to 
reward employees whenever possible, since we all contribute to our company’s success with our hard 
work. This policy clarifies how we choose which employees to reward and how we calculate bonus 
amounts.  
Scope  
This policy applies to all regular full -time and part -time employees and employees with contracts of more 
than one year Seasonal employees, interns and temporary employees with a contract of less than one 
year are not eligible for bonuses.  
We may modify this policy and our bonus plans at any time without notice.  
Only written promises of bonuses will be considered valid. If your manager or another executive 
(including the C -suite) verbally promises you a bonus, they can not follow through unless they put it in 
writing and HR approves it.  
Bonuses can be either discretionary or nondiscretionary:  
● Discretionary bonuses are determined at our company’s sole discretion. They aren’t promised to 
employees and we can’t guarantee anyone will receive them. For example, we may pay a bonus 
to reward an employee who showed exemplary performance at a particular  time.  
● Nondiscretionary bonuses are promised or announced to employees and guaranteed to those 
who meet our established criteria for the bonus. For example, we may promise to pay 
nondiscretionary bonuses to reward teams for meeting specific targets.  
One important difference between discretionary and nondiscretionary bonuses in the U.S. is that 
nondiscretionary bonuses must be included in overtime pay calculations. Our company will follow its 
legal obligations.  
Policy elements  
Our company rewards employees for outstanding individual performance, as well as their contributions 
that help us achieve company goals. For this reason, we award bonuses in three forms:  
 ● Lump sum bonus.  
● Year -end bonus.  
● Incentive plans.  
Lump -sum bonuses  
Our company may award lump -sum bonuses (one -time bonus payments) to employees who show 
exemplary performance. We define “exemplary performance” as:  
● Exceeding goals, either financial or nonfinancial.  
● Performing additional duties from what is expected.  
● Serving as a good example of professional behavior to other employees (e.g. teamwork, ethics, 
leadership.)  
When managers know their team member deserves a bonus, they should send a formal written 
recommendation to their Department Head and HR, explaining how their team member showed 
exemplary performance.  
HR will:  
● Review and approve recommendations with the input of Department Heads based on available 
budget. Lump -sum bonuses can not exceed [ 10% of base salary/ $2,000/ etc .] Bonuses [ for 
executives/ that exceed $1,000 ] need to be approved and signed by [ CEO/ President .] 
● Send a formal letter to the team member who showed exemplary performance congratulating 
them and informing them that they will receive a bonus.  
● Coordinate with the Finance Department to arrange for paying bonuses on time. Employees 
should receive their bonus within [ the next two pay periods/ one month after approval/ etc. ] 
Lump -sum bonuses are discretionary.  
Year -end bonus  
Our company’s policy gives the executive team the ability to decide on year -end bonuses for all 
employees. There are two conditions for this bonus:  
● Our company should have exceeded its annual financial goals.  
● The board of directors must approve the bonuses.  
If these two conditions are satisfied, then our company will give bonuses to employees who:  
● Are employed by our company on the day when the bonus must be paid.  
● Have not announced they intend to resign either verbally or in writing.  
● Have received at least satisfactory performance reviews.  
We will pay out bonuses according to this tiered system:  
 ● Employees who were employed by our company for the entire year will receive a year -end bonus 
payment of 10% of their annual salary.  
● Employees who are employed for at least six months will receive a prorated amount.  
● Employees who are employed for fewer than six months  will receive a 2.5%  bonus.  
Bonus incentive plans  
Our company may set up incentive plans at the beginning of each year. These plans may involve:  
● Incentive bonuses to encourage employees to achieve annual company financial goals.  
These are company -wide bonuses that may be announced at the beginning of the year by senior 
leaders. [ These bonuses may be calculated with a tiered system (e.g. 5% for hitting 80% of the 
goal, 10% for hitting the goal and 20% for exceeding the goal.) ] HR should give a formal payout 
plan to each employee.  
● Incentive bonuses for achieving or exceeding individual and team targets.  Department 
Heads are responsible for formulating these plans and setting specific goals. For example, they 
may decide to pay a quarterly bonus (a percentage of individual sales) to sales teams that 
exceed their sales or revenue targets. Department Heads s hould submit their plan to HR and the 
CEO for approval [ within the first quarter of the year .] 
Keep in mind that bonuses are subject to taxation (local, state and federal taxes.)

Employee Code of Conduct  
As an employee, you are responsible to behave appropriately at work. We outline our expectations here. 
We can’t cover every single case of conduct, but we trust you to always use your best judgement. 
Reach out to your manager or HR if you face any issues o r have any questions.  
Dress code  
Our company’s  official dress code  is [Business/ Business Casual/ Smart Casual/ Casual. ] This includes 
[slacks/ loafers/ blouses/ boots. ] However, an employee’s position may also inform how they should 
dress. If you frequently meet with clients or prospects, please conform to a more formal dress code. We 
expect you to be clean when coming to work and avoid wearing clothes that are unprofes sional (e.g. 
workout clothes.)  
 
 As long as you conform with our guidelines above, we don’t have specific expectations about what types 
of clothes or accessories you should wear.  
We also respect and permit grooming styles, clothing and accessories that are dictated by religious 
beliefs, ethnicity or disability.  
Cyber security and digital devices  
This section deals with all things digital at work. We want to set some guidelines for using computers, 
phones, our internet connection and social media to  ensure security  and protect our assets.  
Internet usage  
Our corporate  internet connection is primarily for business . But, you can occasionally use our connection 
for personal purposes as long as they don’t interfere with your job responsibilities. Also, we expect you 
to temporarily halt personal activities that slow down our internet connection (e.g. uploading photos) if 
you’re asked to.  
You must not use our internet connection to:  
● Download or upload obscene, offensive or illegal material.  
● Send confidential information to unauthorized recipients.  
● Invade another person’s privacy and gain access to sensitive information.  
● Download or upload pirated movies, music, material or software.  
● Visit potentially dangerous websites that can compromise our network and computers’ safety.  
● Perform unauthorized or illegal actions, like hacking, fraud or buying/selling illegal goods.  
Cell phone  
We allow  use of cell phones at work . But, we also want to ensure that your devices won’t distract you 
from your work or disrupt our workplace. We ask you to follow a few simple rules:  
● Use your cell phone in a manner that benefits your work (business calls, productivity apps, 
calendars.)  
● Keep personal calls brief and use an empty meeting room or common area so as not to disturb 
your colleagues.  
● Avoid playing games on your phone or texting excessively.  
● Don't use your phone for any reason while driving a company vehicle.  
● Don’t use your phone to record confidential information.  
● Don’t download or upload inappropriate, illegal or obscene material using our corporate internet 
connection.  
Also, you must not use your phone in areas where cell phone use is explicitly prohibited (e.g. 
laboratories.)  
 
 Corporate email  
Email is essential to our work. You should use your  company email  primarily for work, but we allow 
some uses of your company email for personal reasons.  
● Work -related use . You can use your corporate email for work -related purposes without 
limitations. For example, you can sign up for newsletters and online services that will help you in 
your job or professional growth.  
● Personal use . You can use your email for personal reasons as long as you keep it safe, and 
avoid spamming and disclosing confidential information. For example, you can send emails to 
friends and family and download ebooks, guides and other safe content for your person al use.  
Our general expectations  
No matter how you use your corporate email, we expect you to avoid:  
● Signing up for illegal, unreliable, disreputable or suspect websites and services.  
● Sending unauthorized marketing content or emails.  
● Registering for a competitor’s services, unless authorized.  
● Sending insulting or discriminatory messages and content.  
● Spamming other people’s emails, including your coworkers.  
In general, use strong passwords and be vigilant in catching emails that carry malware or phishing 
attempts. If you are not sure that an email you received is safe, ask our [ Security Specialists .] 
Social media  
We want to provide practical advice to prevent careless use of  social media in our workplace . We 
address two types of social media uses: using personal social media at work and representing our 
company through social media.  
Using personal social media at work  
You are permitted to access your personal accounts at work. But, we expect you to act responsibly, 
according to our policies and ensure that you stay productive. Specifically, we ask you to:  
● Discipline yourself . Avoid getting sidetracked by your social platforms.  
● Ensure others know that your personal account or statements don’t represent our 
company.  For example, use a disclaimer such as “opinions are my own.”  
● Avoid sharing intellectual property (e.g trademarks) or confidential information . Ask your 
manager or PR first before you share company news that’s not officially announced.  
● Avoid any defamatory, offensive or derogatory content.  You may violate our company’s anti -
harassment policy if you direct such content towards colleagues, clients or partners.  
 
 Representing our company through social media  
If you handle our social media accounts or speak on our company’s behalf, we expect you to protect our 
company’s image and reputation. Specifically, you should:  
● Be respectful, polite and patient.  
● Avoid speaking on matters outside your field of expertise when possible.  
● Follow our confidentiality and data protection policies and observe laws governing copyrights, 
trademarks, plagiarism and fair use.  
● Coordinate with our [ PR/Marketing department ] when you’re about to share any major -impact 
content.  
● Avoid deleting or ignoring comments for no reason.  
● Correct or remove any misleading or false content as quickly as possible.  
Conflict of interest  
When you are experiencing a  conflict of interest , your personal goals are no longer aligned with your 
responsibilities towards us. For example, owning stocks of one of our competitors is a conflict of interest.  
In other cases, you may be faced with an ethical issue. For example, accepting a bribe may benefit you 
financially, but it is illegal and against our business code of ethics. If we become aware of such 
behaviour, you will lose your job and may face legal t rouble.  
For this reason, conflicts of interest are a serious issue for all of us. We expect you to be vigilant to spot 
circumstances that create conflicts of interest, either to yourself or for your direct reports. Follow our 
policies and always act in our company ’s best interests. Whenever possible, do not let personal or 
financial interests get in the way of your job. If you are experiencing an ethical dilemma, talk to your 
manager or HR and we will try to help you resolve it.  
Employee relationships  
We want to ensure that relationships between employees are appropriate and harmonious. We outline 
our guidelines and we ask you to always behave professionally.  
Fraternization  
Fraternization  refers to dating or being friends with your colleagues. In this policy, “dating” equals 
consensual romantic relationships and sexual relations. Non -consensual relationships constitute sexual 
violence and we prohibit them explicitly.  
Dating colleagues  
If you start dating a colleague, we expect you to maintain professionalism and keep personal 
discussions outside of our workplace.  
 
 You are also obliged to respect your colleagues who date each other. We won’t tolerate sexual jokes, 
malicious gossip and improper comments. If you witness this kind of behavior, please report it to HR.  
Dating managers  
To avoid accusations of favoritism, abuse of authority and sexual harassment, supervisors must not date 
their direct reports. This restriction extends to every manager above an employee.  
Also, if you act as a hiring manager, you aren’t allowed to hire your partner to your team. You can refer 
them for employment to other teams or departments where you don’t have any managerial or hiring 
authority.  
Friendships at work  
Employees who work together may naturally form friendships either in or outside of the workplace. We 
encourage this relationship between peers, as it can help you communicate and collaborate. But, we 
expect you to focus on your work and keep personal dispu tes outside of our workplace.  
Employment of relatives  
Everyone in our company should be hired, recognized or promoted because of their skills, character and 
work ethic. We would not like to see phenomena of nepotism, favoritism or conflicts of interest, so we 
will place some restrictions on  hiring employees’ relatives . 
To our company, a “relative” is someone who is related by blood or marriage within the third degree to 
an employee. This includes: parents, grandparents, in -laws, spouses or domestic partners, children, 
grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephe ws, step -parents, step -children and adopted 
children.  
As an employee, you can refer your relatives to work with our company. Here are our only restrictions:  
● [You must not be involved in a supervisory/reporting relationship with a relative .] 
● [You cannot be transferred, promoted or hired inside a reporting relationship with a relative .] 
● [You cannot be part of a hiring committee, when your relative is interviewed for that position .] 
If you become related to a manager or direct report after you both become employed by our company, 
we may have to [ transfer one of you .] 
Workplace visitors  
If you want to invite a  visitor to our offices , please ask for permission from our [ HR Manager/ Security 
Officer/ Office Manager ] first. Also, inform our [ reception/ gate/ front -office ] of your visitor’s arrival. 
Visitors should sign in and show identification. They will receive passes and will be asked to return them 
to [reception/ gate/ front -office ] once their visit is complete.  
 
 When you have office visitors, you also have responsibilities. You should:  
● Always tend to your visitors (especially when they are underage.)  
● Keep your visitors away from areas where there are dangerous machines, chemicals, 
confidential records or sensitive equipment.  
● Prevent your visitors from proselytizing your colleagues, gathering donations or requesting 
participation in activities while on our premises.  
Anyone who delivers orders, mail or packages for employees should remain at our building’s reception 
or gate. If you are expecting a delivery, [ front office employees/ security guards ] will notify you so you 
may collect it.  
Solicitation and distribution  
Solicitation is any form of requesting money, support or participation for products, groups, organizations 
or causes which are unrelated to our company (e.g. religious proselytism, asking for petition signatures.) 
Distribution means disseminating literatur e or material for commercial or political purposes.  
We don’t allow solicitation  and distribution by non -employees in our workplace. As an employee, you 
may solicit from your colleagues only when you want to:  
● Ask colleagues to help organize events for another employee (e.g. adoption/birth of a child, 
promotion, retiring.)  
● Seek support for a cause, charity or fundraising event sponsored, funded, organized or 
authorized by our company.  
● Invite colleagues to employee activities for an authorized non -business purpose (e.g. recreation, 
volunteering.)  
● Ask colleagues to participate in employment -related activities or groups protected by law (e.g. 
trade unions.)  
In all cases, we ask that you do not disturb or distract colleagues from their work.

Employee training and development
Compensation & development template
In this section, we outline our guidelines for compensating employees according to their employment status. We also describe our performance management and employee development policies.
Compensation status
[Insert this section if you are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in the U.S.]
There are two types of employees under FLSA guidelines:
Non-exempt employees, who are covered by the FLSA’s minimum wage and overtime provisions.
Exempt employees, who aren’t covered by the FLSA because they meet three exemption criteria: (a) they are paid at least [$23,600] per year ([$455] per week), (b) they are paid on a salary basis, and (c) they perform exempt job duties ("executive," "professional" and "administrative.") Most employees must meet all three criteria to be exempt.
If you are unsure as to whether you should be exempt or not, please ask HR to clarify your status.
The FLSA excludes some types of jobs (e.g. railroad workers, truck drivers) because they are covered by other federal laws. Some other workers, like outside salespeople, are excluded by definition. Feel free to ask HR for clarifications any time.
Overtime
Occasionally, we may need you to work more than your regular working hours. We will pay for overtime work according to local and national laws.
[Insert this if employees are in the U.S: If you are an exempt employee, you are not entitled to overtime pay by federal law. In the event that an exempt employee must work overtime, we will set a cap for overtime hours at [10 hours per week] to prevent overworking and burnout.
If you are a non-exempt employee, you are entitled to overtime pay of one and a half times your wage. Please record your overtime hours accurately, so we can calculate your pay correctly. We also ask you to work overtime only after it’s authorized by your supervisor to make our record-keeping easier.]
Payroll
We pay your salary or wage [at the end of month/ every 15th and end of month] by [checks/ bank transfers/ cash.] If you are an hourly employee, you should be diligent [in clocking in and out/using our timesheet software] so we can accurately calculate your pay.
Performance management
We have built our performance management practices to:
Ensure you understand your job responsibilities and have specific goals to meet.
Provide you with actionable and timely feedback on your work.
Invest in development opportunities that help you grow professionally.
Recognize and reward your work in financial or non-financial ways (e.g. employee awards.)
To meet these objectives, we have:
Established [annual/ bi-annual/ quarterly] performance reviews. During these reviews, your manager will fill out your performance evaluation report and arrange a meeting with you to discuss it. Through these discussions, managers aim to recognize employees who are good at their jobs, identify areas of improvement and talk about career moves. Pay increases or bonuses are not guaranteed. But, we encourage managers to recommend rewards for their team members when they deserve them. There won’t be any forced ranking or other comparison between employees, as our goal is to help all employees improve and develop their careers.
Instructed all managers to meet with their team members once per [week] to provide feedback and talk about their work and motivations. This way, you can receive feedback in a timely manner and avoid surprises during your [annual/ bi-annual/ quarterly] performance review.
How we expect managers to lead employees
If you manage a team, you are responsible for your team members’ performance. To conduct effective regular meetings and performance evaluations, we expect you to:
Set clear objectives. Your team members should know what you expect of them. When you first hire someone to your team, ensure they understand their job duties. Set specific goals for each team member (and team-wide if applicable.) Revisit those goals during [annual/ bi-annual/ quarterly] performance reviews.
Provide useful feedback. During scheduled meetings with your team members, give them both guidance and praise, as appropriate. Be fair and specific to help them understand and implement your feedback.
Keep your team members involved. There should be two-way communication between you and your team. Make your expectations clear, but always take your team members’ motivations and aspirations into account. Discuss training and development opportunities that may interest your team members.
Keep logs with important incidents about each one of your team members. These logs help you evaluate your team, but may also prove useful when rewarding, promoting or terminating your team members.
Employee training and development
We owe our success to our employees. To show our gratitude, we will invest in our employees professional development. We want employees to feel confident about improving their efficiency and productivity. We also want to help our employees achieve personal growth and success.
Each employee has [$1,000] annually to spend on educational activities or material. Subscriptions and books are included in this budget, unless they are necessary for you to complete your everyday duties. Send your expenses to HR [by email/ expenses software.]
Apart from online courses, we offer these training opportunities:
Formal training sessions (individual or corporate.)
Employee coaching and mentoring.
Seats at industry conferences.
On-the-job training.
Job shadowing.
Job rotation.
Development is a collective process. Team members and managers should regularly discuss learning needs and opportunities. And it’s HR’s responsibility to facilitate any development activities and processes.

Employee performance management policy

An Employee Performance Management Policy is invaluable as it provides a structured approach for enhancing productivity, aligning individual goals with organizational objectives, and fostering continuous improvement. It promotes transparency, motivates employees, and aids in identifying and addressing performance gaps effectively.
What is a Performance Management Policy?
Performance Management is a systematic process that involves improving the effectiveness of a company by improving the performance of its employees. This policy outlines the company's approach to managing employee performance, including the setting of objectives, performance reviews, feedback, and development plans.

A Performance Management Policy should include:

The definition of performance management.
The responsibilities of the employer and employees in the performance management process.
The process for setting objectives and conducting performance reviews.
The steps the organization will take to address performance issues.
The potential consequences for unsatisfactory performance.
This Performance Management Policy template is ready to be tailored to your company’s needs and should be considered a starting point for setting up your employment policies.

Policy brief & purpose
Our Performance Management Policy provides a framework for managing, enhancing and improving the performance of our employees. This policy provides practical advice to avoid issues that might arise from performance management.

Scope
This policy applies to all employees.

Policy elements
Understanding Performance Management
Performance Management is an ongoing process of communication between a supervisor and an employee that occurs throughout the year, in support of accomplishing the strategic objectives of the organization. The communication process includes clarifying expectations, setting objectives, identifying goals, providing feedback, and reviewing results.

Implementing performance management
We are committed to maintaining a positive work environment and treating all employees fairly. In that spirit, we will:

Ensure that performance objectives are clear, measurable, and mutually agreed upon
Maintain open lines of communication with all employees to address concerns promptly

Regularly review and update our performance management processes to ensure they are fair and transparent
Addressing performance issues

If you are experiencing performance issues, we encourage you to:

Seek feedback and clarification on your performance objectives
Discuss these issues with your supervisor or HR department as soon as possible
Seek advice and support from the HR department

We will investigate all reports thoroughly and take necessary actions to resolve the situation. This may include additional training, changes to work practices, or performance improvement plans.

Disciplinary consequences
If an employee's performance does not meet the agreed-upon standards, they may face disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Examples of such behavior include, but are not limited to:

Consistently failing to meet performance objectives.
Neglecting duties or responsibilities.

Leaving our company template  
In this section, we describe our procedures regarding resignation and  termination of our employees . We 
also refer to our progressive discipline process that may sometimes result in termination.  
[Insert this if employees are in the U.S: We remind you that in the U.S. employment is “at -will.” This 
means that you or our company may terminate our employment relationship at any time and for any 
non-discriminatory reason .] 
Progressive discipline  
Here we outline steps we will take to address employee misconduct. We want to give employees a 
chance to correct their behavior when possible and assist them in doing so. We also want to ensure that 
we thoroughly investigate and handle serious offenses.  
Our progressive discipline process  has six steps of increasing severity. These steps are:  
● Verbal warning  
● Informal meeting with supervisor  
● Formal reprimand  
● Formal disciplinary meeting  
 ● Penalties  
● Termination  
Different offenses correspond to different steps in our disciplinary process. For example, minor, one -time 
offenses (e.g. breach of our dress code policy) will trigger Step 1. More severe violations (e.g. sexual 
harassment) will trigger step 5.  
If you manage employees, inform them when you launch a progressive discipline process. Pointing out a 
performance issue is not necessarily a verbal warning and may be part of your regular feedback. If you 
judge that progressive discipline is appropriate, l et your team member know and ask HR to help you 
explain our full procedure.  
Managers may skip or repeat steps at their discretion. Our company may treat circumstances differently 
from that described in this policy. But, we are always obliged to act fairly and lawfully and document 
every stage of our progressive discipline process.  
Keep in mind that our company isn’t obliged to follow the steps of our progressive discipline process. As 
you are employed “at -will” in the U.S, we may terminate you directly without launching a progressive 
discipline process. For serious offenses (e.g. se xual harassment), we may terminate you without 
warning.  
Resignation  
You resign when you voluntarily inform HR or your manager that you will stop working for our company. 
We also consider you resigned if you don’t come to work for [ three ] consecutive days without notice.  
You are not obliged to give us advance notice before resigning. But, for efficiency’s sake, and to make 
sure our workplace runs smoothly, we ask that you give at least [ two weeks ] notice, if possible. If you 
hold a highly specialized or executive position, we ask that you give us at least [ a month’s ] notice, when 
possible.  
We accept verbal resignations, but we prefer that you submit a written and signed notice of resignation 
for our HR records. We will reply with an acceptance of resignation letter within [ two days .] HR will 
inform your manager that you are resigning if you haven’t already done so. Whether you want to  
announce your resignation  to your team is up to you, but we encourage you to be open.  
Tuition or relocation reimbursement  
If you have relocated or studied at our company’s expense, you are bound by your contract to remain 
with us for at least [ two years .] If you resign before that period, you may have to reimburse us for part or 
all of these expenses.  
Forced resignation  
 You can resign anytime at your own free will and nobody should force you into resignation. Forcing 
someone into resigning (directly or indirectly) is constructive dismissal and we won’t tolerate it. 
Specifically, we prohibit employees from:  
● Creating a hostile or unpleasant environment.  
● Demanding or coaxing an employee to resign.  
● Victimizing, harassing or retaliating against an employee.  
● Forcing an employee to resign by taking unofficial adverse actions (e.g. demotions, increased 
workload).  
Termination  
Terminating an employee  is always unpleasant but sometimes necessary. If that happens, we want to 
ensure we act lawfully and respectfully.  
We may terminate an employee either for cause or without cause.  
● For cause termination  is justified when an employee breaches their contract, engages in illegal 
activities (e.g. embezzlement), disrupts our workplace (e.g. harasses colleagues), performs 
below acceptable standards or causes damage or financial loss to our company.  
● Without cause termination  refers to redundancies or layoffs that may be necessary if we cease 
some of our operations or re -assign job duties within teams. We will follow applicable laws 
regarding notice and payouts.  
We will offer severance pay to eligible employees. We may also help employees who were terminated 
without cause to find work elsewhere, if possible.  
We may also compensate accrued vacation and sick leave upon termination, depending on local law. 
Whenever local law doesn’t have relevant stipulations, we will pay accrued leave only to those who 
weren’t terminated for cause. We will also take into account  union agreements and abide by agreed 
terms.  
If you manage team members, avoid wrongful dismissal. When you terminate an employee for cause, 
we expect you to be certain you made the right choice and keep accurate performance and/or 
disciplinary records to support your decision.  
References  
When we terminate employees, we may provide references for those who leave in good standing. This 
means that employees shouldn’t have been terminated for cause. If you are laid off, you may receive 
references. Please ask your manager.  
If you resign, you may ask for references and your manager has a right to oblige or refuse.

Employee Training and Development Policy
This Employee Training and Development Policy is ready to be tailored to your company’s needs and should be considered a starting point for setting up your employment policies. An employee training and development policy may also be referred to as Staff Training and Development Policy or Employee Development Policy.
Policy brief & purpose
Our Employee Development company policy refers to the company’s learning and development programs and activities.
In the modern competitive environment, employees need to replenish their knowledge and acquire new skills to do their jobs better. This will benefit both them and the company. We want them to feel confident about improving efficiency and productivity, as well as finding new ways towards personal development and success.
Scope
This policy applies to all permanent, full-time or part-time, employees of the company. Employees with temporary/short-term contracts might attend trainings at their manager’s discretion.
This policy doesn’t cover supplementary employees like contractors or consultants.
Policy elements
Employees, managers and Human Resources (HR) should all collaborate to build a continuous professional development (CPD) culture. It’s an employee’s responsibility to seek new learning opportunities. It’s a manager’s responsibility to coach their teams and identify employee development needs. And it’s HR’s responsibility to facilitate any staff development activities and processes.
What do we mean by training and development?
In general, we approve and encourage the following employee trainings:
Formal training sessions (individual or corporate)
Employee Coaching and Mentoring
Participating in conferences
On-the-job training
Job shadowing
Job rotation
As part of our learning and development provisions, we can also arrange for subscriptions or educational material, so employees will have access to news, articles and other material that can help them become better at their job. There are two conditions for this:
Subscription/Material should be job-related
All relevant fees should not exceed a set limit per person
This list doesn’t include software licences or other tools that are absolutely necessary for employees’ jobs.
Individual training programs
The company has certain provisions regarding individual training programs. All employees that have worked for the company more than four months are eligible to participate in external training programs individually or in teams. We will set a budget for each employee at the beginning of a year, which we’ll renew annually. Employees can be absent for training for up to 10 days per year.
Employees can choose to attend as many training programs as they want, provided they don’t exceed the budget and day limit. If they do, they’ll have to use their paid time off (PTO) and pay any extra fees themselves.
Employees may have to bring proof of attendance.
Any employee training that the company mandates (e.g. due to inadequacies of an employee’s performance or changes in their job description) is excluded from the training budget and time limit. The company may take care of the entire cost.
All trainings should consider what employees need and how they can learn best. This is why, we encourage employees and managers to consider multiple training methods like workshops, e-learning, lectures and more.
Corporate training programs
We might occasionally engage experts to train our employees. The company will cover the entire cost in this case. Examples of this kind of training and development are:
Equal employment opportunity training
Diversity training
Leadership training for managers
Conflict resolution training for employees
This category also includes training conducted by internal experts and managers. Examples are:
Training new employees
Training teams in company-related issues (e.g. new systems or policy changes)
Training employees to prepare them for promotions, transfers or new responsibilities
Employees won’t have to pay or use their leave for these types of trainings. Attendance records may be part of the process.
Other types of training
Both employees and their managers are responsible for continuous learning. Employees should show willingness to improve by asking their managers for direction and advice. Managers should do the same with their own superiors, while encouraging and mentoring their subordinates.
Employees and managers are responsible for finding the best ways to CPD. They can experiment with job rotation, job shadowing and other types of on-the-job training (without disrupting daily operations). We also encourage employees to use their rights for self-paced learning by asking for educational material and access to other resources within allocated budget.
General guidelines:
All eligible employees are covered by this policy without discriminating against rank or protected characteristics.
Managers should evaluate the success of training efforts. They should keep records for reference and better improvement opportunities.
All employee development efforts should respect cost and time limitations, as well as individual and business needs.
Employees should try to make the most out of their trainings by studying and finding ways to apply knowledge to their work.
Employees are encouraged to use up their allocated training budget and time.
Procedure
This procedure should be followed when employees want to attend external training sessions or conferences:
Employees (or their team leaders) identify the need for training.
Employees and team leaders discuss potential training programs or methods and come up with suggestions.
Employees or team leaders contact HR and briefly present their proposal. They might also have to complete a form.
HR researches the proposal, with attention to budget and training content.
HR approves or rejects the proposal. If they reject it, they should provide employees with reasons in writing.
If HR approves, they will make arrangements for dates, accommodation, reserving places etc.
In cases where the company doesn’t pay for the training directly, employees will have to pay and send invoices or receipts to HR. HR will approve employee reimbursement according to this information.
If an employee decides to drop or cancel a training, they’ll have to inform HR immediately. They’ll also have to shoulder any cancellation or other fees.
In cases where training ends with examination, employees are obliged to submit the results. If they don’t pass the exam, they can retake it on their own expense.
Generally, the company will cover any training fees including registration and examination (one time). They may also cover transportation, accommodation and personal expenses. This is left to HR’s discretion. If HR decides to cover these costs, they should make arrangements themselves (e.g. tickets, hotel reservations). Any other covered expense that employees have will be reimbursed, after employees bring all relevant receipts and invoices.
If employees want subscriptions, they should contact HR directly or ask their managers to do so. HR will preferably set up the subscription. In some rare cases, they might give formal approval to employees so they can do it themselves. Once employees make arrangements, they should inform HR of the cost and any other details in writing. Any relevant invoices should also be sent to HR.
HR’s responsibilities also include:
Assessing training needs
Maintaining budgets and training schedules
Assisting with learning and development activities and strategies
Promoting corporate training programs and employee development plans
Calculating learning and development KPIs whenever possible and decide on improvements

Flexible working hours policy
This Flexible Hours Company Policy template is ready to be tailored to your company’s needs and should be considered a starting point for setting up your employment policies. A flexible hours policy may also be referred to as a flexible working hours policy or a flexible work schedule policy.
Policy brief & purpose
Our flexible hours company policy outlines our provisions for employees who want to change their working hours, days or weeks.
Scope
This policy applies to all our employees, who need an alternative arrangement about their work schedules and who are eligible by nature of their job.
Policy elements
We recognize that some employees need to work flexible hours. Example reasons are:
Parenting
Doctor appointments or other medical circumstances
Work-life balance
What does it mean to have a flexible work schedule?
Flexible hours can refer to a number of different arrangements:
Flexible working time when employees choose to shift their everyday schedule by starting the day later or leaving earlier. The total of working hours doesn't change. “Core hours” may be established during which an employee is obliged to be present at the workplace.
Reduced hours when an employee works for less than the standard working hours either by fewer hours per day or by fewer days per week. In such cases salary is calculated anew depending on the new schedule.
Compressed week when employees work longer hours on a number of days per week so they can take time off on the remaining days. Total working hours and compensation remain the same.
“Flexible year” when an employee must work a specific amount of hours per year with little limitation as to when.
Job sharing when two people divide their schedule to do the same job.
To determine whether an employee is eligible for flexible arrangements, we consider:
The nature of the employee’s job. For example, if the job requires attendance at specific hours or every day per week or has a full time workload, then the employee is not eligible for flexible working hours.
The needs of the employee's team or department. For example, some departments (e.g. finance) may require employees to be present due to the amount of incoming paper documents.
The impact on colleagues. For example, if the department’s operations are largely dependent on teamwork, then the employee is less likely to freely modify his/her working schedules.
The duration of the arrangement. For example, an employee may have flexible hours on a specific time but may have to follow standard schedule at some other time.
The impact on customers. For example, we don't want any flexible work arrangement to have a big impact on customer satisfaction.
Procedure
If our employee initiates the request for flexible schedule then the following procedure must be followed:
The employee files an official request with their manager and HR explaining the reasons for their request.
Their manager approves/rejects their request after carefully considering the above criteria.
HR approves
The employee and their manager meet to discuss details of the arrangement and set specific goals and responsibilities.
HR puts the agreement in writing and all parties must sign it.
The decision must be revisited and discontinued if it negatively affects productivity or efficiency of the individual or the department.
In cases where the employer does not approve of the employee’s request, the employee must receive an official letter that includes the reasons why.
When the request is initiated by the employer, then the employee must be formally notified and sign the agreement along with the other parties.

New hire company policy
This New Hire Company Policy template is ready to be tailored to your company’s needs and should be considered a starting point for setting up your employment policies.
Policy brief & purpose
Our New Hire policy refers to our efforts to help new employees settle in their new job. We will provide new hires with necessary information about their new job and our company, as well as facilitate a rising feeling of comfort around an unknown workplace.
Scope
This policy applies to all employees who were recently received and accepted an offer of employment from us.
Policy elements
Our onboarding efforts will aim to:
Make new hires feel welcome.
Help new hires get to know their team.
Provide useful information about their position.
Inform our new hire about company principles, new employee orientation, mission and procedures.
Actions
We have implemented steps to meet our onboarding goals. Some of those steps refer to the period before our new hire’s first day and some refer to their first months on the job.
Before a new hire starts work
HR should:
Announce our new employee's start date and basic personal information to other staff of the department (especially their new team.)
Enter our new employee’s information in our company database and set up their individual e-mails, accounts and phones.
Create an onboarding program with specific activities, timelines, participants and documentation.
Prepare our new hire's workspace with all equipment and material necessary.
Send an onboarding “package” to our new hire. This "package" will include documents with basic information about their new job (e.g. general duties), our company (e.g. dress code, working hours) and orientation process (e.g. Day 1, Day 2 etc.)
After our new hire starts work
The day our new hire starts working with us
On our new hire's first day, HR and our new hire's manager should:
Welcome new hires in an organized manner. Everyone involved (reception, manager, co-workers) must be prepared for our new employee's arrival.
Show new hires to their new workstation and help them familiarize themselves with their surroundings.
Introduce new hires to colleagues and upper management when applicable.
Present important documents to review (Employee Handbook, previous reports etc.). This paperwork must be kept at a bare minimum so as not to overwhelm our new hire.
Give short presentations so our employee can become familiar with our mission, procedures, values and policies.
Our new hire's first week on the job
The first few days our new hire spends in our company are important to help them settle in. So, we advise their manager to:
Assist our new hire in building a communication network (who to contact for what, who to report to etc.)
Ease employees into their new position by assigning simple but meaningful work from the start. Our employee should not have to deal with urgent work or duties not involved in their job description during their first days.
Arrange for our new hire to shadow colleagues during their work so they can get hands-on experience on how things are done.
Schedule lunch or breaks so our new hire can socialize.
Assign a mentor.
We want our new employee to feel respected and valued early on. Our new hires' supervisor can implement onboarding activities that aren't included in this policy. We encourage collective activities since they help new hires feel part of a team.
New recruits may need more than a few days to fully grasp their responsibilities and learn to be productive in their new workplace. Onboarding may go on until the employees feel sure that they can function on their own.

Severance packages
Eligible employees who are terminated due to reasons other than misconduct or poor performance may receive a severance package that includes payment for the applicable notice period, continuation of benefits coverage, and outplacement assistance (where appropriate). The specific components of the severance package will depend on the employee's length of service and employment contract.
Job Abandonment
An employee who fails to report for work without authorization for three consecutive working days (or five consecutive calendar days) will be deemed to have abandoned their job. In such cases, the employee's final pay and benefits will be calculated according to the applicable laws and regulations, and company property or equipment must be returned within seven days from the date of termination.
Written notice procedures
1. Authorized representatives: Only designated HR personnel or management officials are authorized to issue written notice of termination.

3. Required documentation: A copy of the signed termination letter, employee ID card, and any other relevant documents must be attached to the notice.
4. Confirmation of delivery: The person delivering the notice must obtain a signature from the employee as proof of delivery. If the employee refuses to sign, the notice will be deemed served when it is emailed or mailed.
Support services
The organization may offer support services, such as career counseling or outplacement assistance, to affected employees. These services will be provided at no cost to the employee and may include access to job search resources, resume-building workshops, and networking opportunities.
Confidentiality
All information related to an employee's termination must be kept confidential during and after the termination process. Employees who breach this policy may face disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
Dispute resolution
If an employee disputes the terms of their termination, they should contact the HR department in writing within 10 working days from the date of termination. The dispute will be investigated promptly, and a response will be provided within 20 working days. If necessary, the organization may engage third-party mediation services to resolve the dispute.
Updates and amendments
This policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure compliance with changing laws and regulations. Any updates or amendments will be communicated to all employees through the organization's intranet, email, or other appropriate channels.

Work from Home Policy Sample
This Work from Home Policy template can be tailored to your company’s needs and is designed as a starting point for establishing employment policies on working from home. This sample policy should be modified according to your company’s specific values. A Work from Home Policy may also be referred to as a Telecommuting Policy or Home-Based Work Policy.
Policy brief & purpose
We designed our work from home policy to make sure that working from home is beneficial to our employees and company.
Scope
This company work from home policy applies to all our employees who prefer working from home. 
Are employees allowed to work from home?
Employees are allowed to work from home only if their job duties permit it. For example, people who are obliged to come in direct physical contact with customers are not eligible to telecommute under this policy. But, employees who carry out most of their work on a computer can occasionally work off-site.
Policy elements
Employees work from home or telecommute when they complete their work at a place located outside of our company’s premises. They may work from home:
Full-time
On certain days
Everyday, dividing their schedule between being present at the office and working from a remote location.
Work from home arrangements can be occasional, temporary or permanent.
Reasons that could demand telecommuting include but are not limited to:
Parenting
Bad weather
Emergencies
Medical reasons
Work-life balance
Overlong commute
Other reasons for working from home depend on employees and managers' judgement.
How to determine whether an employee can work from home
We advise both employees and managers to consider these elements before asking/approving work from home:
Is the employee eligible by nature of their job?
Are there any cybersecurity and data privacy concerns?
Will collaboration with the employee's team become difficult?
Do employees have the necessary equipment or software installed at home?
What are the conditions of employees' home or alternative place of work (noise, internet connection etc.)
Requesting Work from Home Procedure
When employees plan to work from home, this procedure must be followed:
Employees file a request through email or a Human Resource Information System (HRIS) at least [two days] in advance.
Their managers must approve their request considering all elements we mentioned above.
If the work from home arrangement spans for more than a week, managers and team members should meet to discuss details and set specific goals, schedules and deadlines.
Employees who need to work from home for unforeseen reasons (e.g. illness or temporary difficult commute) should file their request as soon as possible, so managers can consider and approve it.
Time Zone difference
Sometimes, managers and their team members are in a different time zone. When employees need to work from home for unforeseen reasons, they may not be able to get their request approved in time. In this case, they may stay to work from home and notify the HR department. We advise employees to check in with their managers as soon as their manager clocks in.
Compensation and benefits
Usually, work from home arrangements don't affect employees' employment terms. If working from home has any effect on compensation and benefits, then HR is responsible to create a new contract.

Working hours, time off and leave template
In this section, we explain our provisions for your working hours and time off. We include [five] types of leave and holidays.
Working hours
Our company operates between [9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays.] You may come to work at any time between [9 a.m. and 11 a.m.], depending on your team’s needs.
Some departments may work after hours, too [(e.g. customer support, shipping.)] If you work in these departments, you will follow a shift schedule as needed.
Paid time off (PTO)
Employees receive [20 days] of Paid Time Off (PTO) per year. You PTO accrual begins the day you join our company and you receive [1.7 days per month.] You can take your PTO at any time after your first [week] with us and you [can] use time off you haven’t accrued yet. You will earn one additional day per year after your [first year] with our company, with a cap at [25 days overall.]
If you want to use PTO, send a request [through our HRIS.] If your manager or HR approves, you are permitted to take your leave. You do not have to specify a reason for requesting PTO.
You [can/cannot] transfer any remaining PTO to the next year. We encourage you to use your time off throughout the year.
If you leave our company, we may compensate accrued PTO with your final paycheck according to local law. When the law doesn’t have provisions, we will compensate accrued leave to employees who were not terminated for cause.
Holidays
Our company observes the following holidays:
[New Year’s Day]
[Martin Luther King Day]
[President’s Day]
[Good Friday/Easter Monday]
[Memorial Day]
[Independence Day]
[Labor Day]
[Columbus Day]
[Veterans Day]
[Thanksgiving Day]
[Christmas Day]
If a holiday falls on a day when our company doesn’t operate (e.g. Sunday), we will observe that holiday on the closest business day.
Our company offers a floating day, which you can take as a holiday any day you choose. If you want to observe a religious holiday that isn’t included in our list, we may allow you to take unpaid time off for that day. Or, you may use your PTO.
Holiday pay
Exempt employees are entitled to their normal compensation without any deductions.
Permanent non-exempt employees receive holiday pay as a benefit after they have worked with us for more than [three months.]
Working on a holiday
These holidays are considered “off-days” for most employees. If you need a team member to work on a holiday, inform them at least [three days] in advance.
If you are a non-exempt employee, you will receive your regular hourly rate with a premium for working on a holiday. If you are an exempt employee, we will grant you an additional day of PTO that you must take within [12 months] after that holiday.
We [will/ won’t] count hours you worked on a holiday to decide whether you are entitled to overtime pay.
Sick leave
We offer [one week] of [paid] sick leave. In states or countries where employees are entitled to a greater number of sick leave days by law, we will follow that law. You can take sick leave to recover from short-term illness, injuries, mental issues and other indisposition. If you have the flu or other contagious disease, please use your sick days.
If you become sick, inform your manager and send a sick leave request [through our HRIS.] You may take a partial day off or work from home, but we advise you to rest and recuperate for a day before returning to work.
Use your PTO or arrange for a flexible work schedule if you want to attend routine health care (e.g. doctor’s/dentist’s appointments.)
Occasionally, we may ask you to submit a physician’s note or other medical certification and/or complete a sick leave form. We will do this for insurance purposes if you are absent for more than [three days] of sick leave.
Long-term illness
[Insert this section in your handbook if you employ 50 or more employees in the U.S.: The U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act provides employees 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period with the same group health benefits for medical and family reasons. One of those reasons is to recover from a serious health condition or to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition.
You are eligible for this type of leave if you have worked for us for more than 12 months and you have worked at least 1,250 hours within 12 months before your leave begins. Contact HR for more information when needed.]
Bereavement leave
Losing a loved one is traumatizing. If this happens to you while you work with us, we want to support you and give you time to cope and mourn.
For this reason, we offer [three days] of paid bereavement leave. You may take your bereavement leave on [consecutive/non-consecutive] days to:
Arrange a funeral or memorial service.
Attend a funeral or memorial service.
Resolve matters of inheritance.
Fulfill other family obligations.
Mourn.
If you have to travel long-distance for a funeral or service, you can take [two] additional unpaid days off. If you require more time, please use your PTO.
Jury duty and voting
If you are called for jury duty and you are an exempt employee, you can take [one day] off without deduction from your salary. If local or national law stipulates more days of paid jury duty leave, we will follow the law. On election day, you can take [two hours] off to vote. You can take [a paid half-day off] if you need to travel a short distance to vote. If your trip lasts more days, please use your PTO.
Hourly employees may take [one unpaid day] off for jury duty and voting. If local or national law obliges us to provide hourly employees with paid jury duty leave, we will follow the law.
To keep good records, we ask you to bring us [a copy of your summons for jury duty and a document that proves you served.]
Parental leave
Caring for a newborn is an exciting time for parents. We want to support new mothers and fathers in their first months of parenthood with paternity and maternity leave. Afterwards, we will continue to support parents with [flexible work options and child care.]
Paternity and maternity leave
[Insert this if you’re covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA): The FMLA provides eligible employees with 12-weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for the birth or adoption of a child.You are eligible for this type of leave if you have worked for us for more than 12 months and you have worked at least 1,250 hours within 12 months before your leave begins. Contact HR for more information when needed.]
Our company offers [three months] of paid maternity and paternity leave. If local or national law stipulates longer leave, we will follow the law.
If you are about to be a new mother or father (either through childbirth or adoption), talk to HR to arrange your leave. Please give us at least [three months] notice before your leave begins.
Depending on local or national law, pregnant women can take part of their leave before labor. If you suffer complications during childbirth or have other issues, you can ask for an unpaid leave extension of up to [two months.] Contact HR as soon as possible to arrange this.
Returning to work after parental leave
We are committed to helping new parents transition back to work after their leave ends. We offer:
[Remote working/ Flexible hours.]
[Onsite/ External paid day care.]
[Lactation rooms.]

Workplace harassment policy sample
This Workplace Harassment Policy template is ready to be tailored to your company’s needs and should be considered a starting point for setting up your employment policies. A Workplace Harassment Policy may also be referred to as an Anti-Harassment, Employee Harassment, Sexual Harassment or Racial Harassment Policy.
Policy brief & purpose
Our anti-harassment policy expresses our commitment to maintain a workplace that's free of harassment, so our employees can feel safe and happy. We will not tolerate anyone intimidating, humiliating or sabotaging others in our workplace. We also prohibit wilful discrimination based on [age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, racial, religion or disability.]
Scope
This workplace harassment policy applies to all employees, contractors, public visitors, customers and anyone else whom employees come into contact with at work. For more details on how to recognize, report and deal with sexual harassment and harassment from outside our company, please refer to our sexual harassment policy and our third party harassment policy.
Policy elements
What is the definition of harassment in the workplace?
Harassment includes bullying, intimidation, direct insults, malicious gossip and victimization. We can’t create an exhaustive list, but here are some instances that we consider harassment:
[Sabotaging someone’s work on purpose.]
[Engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature.]
[Commenting derogatorily on a person’s ethnic heritage or religious beliefs.]
[Starting or spreading rumors about a person’s personal life.]
[Ridiculing someone in front of others or singling them out to perform tasks unrelated to their job (e.g. bringing coffee) against their will.]
Sexual harassment is illegal and we will seriously investigate relevant reports. If an employee is found guilty of sexual harassment, they will be terminated.
How to address harassment
If you’re being harassed, whether by a colleague, customer or vendor, you can choose to talk to any of these people:
Offenders. If you suspect that an offender doesn’t realize they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues.) Avoid using this approach with customers or stakeholders.
Your manager. If customers, stakeholders or team members are involved in your claim, you may reach out to your manager. Your manager will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate.
HR. Feel free to reach out to HR in any case of harassment no matter how minor it may seem. For your safety, contact HR as soon as possible in cases of serious harassment (e.g. sexual advances) or if your manager is involved in your claim. Anything you disclose will remain confidential.
Disciplinary Consequences
Punishment for harassment depends on the severity of the offence and may include counseling, reprimands, suspensions or termination.
